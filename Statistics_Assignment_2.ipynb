    "### Q1. Explain the properties of the F-distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The F-distribution is also known as the Fisher-Snedecor distribution.It is a probability distribution that is useful in context of comparing variances of two or more samples.It has several properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Asymmetrical -** The F-distribution is skewed to the right and is not symmetrical. \n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Degrees of freedom -** The F-distribution is defined by two parameters: the degrees of freedom of the numerator(d1) and the degrees of freedom of the denominator(d2).Â  \n",
    "\n",
    "**c) Positive values -** The F-distribution can only have positive values, like a chi-square distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d) F-statistic -** The F-statistic is greater than or equal to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "**e) Curve -** As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator increase, the F-distribution approximates the normal distribution and its shape depends on the values of the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. "

    "It is because when we are using t-test to compare the groups, there has a 5% chance of commiting Type-I Error. When we are using multiple t-test,the chances of error increases. By running two t-tests on the same data you will have increased your chance of \"making a mistake\" to 10%. The formula for determining the new error rate for multiple t-tests is not as simple as multiplying 5% by the number of tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are only making a few multiple comparisons, the results are very similar if you do. As such, three t-tests would be 15% (actually, 14.3%) and so on. These are unacceptable errors.\n",
